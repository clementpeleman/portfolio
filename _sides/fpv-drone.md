intro: |
  In my free time, I like to fly FPV. FPV stands for First-Person-View. It means that you fly based on what a little camera in the drone sees. This video feed is sent in realtime to goggles that you wear on your face. I built this drone myself and designed a simple GoPro mount, which I 3D-printed.
