intro: |
  My masterâ€™s thesis, a pivotal component of my Industrial Design course, was an in-depth exploration into the realm of Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) production within a corporate setting. The crux of my research was to identify and analyze existing bottlenecks that were impeding the efficiency of the MJF production process.

  Upon identifying these bottlenecks, I embarked on a mission to devise strategies and implement solutions aimed at enhancing the efficiency of the said process. This involved a meticulous examination of the production workflow, a comprehensive understanding of the technology involved, and a creative application of design principles.
