  Lots of experience in finetuning and setting up self-hosted instances of Onyx.
  Onyx is an open-source AI platform connected to your company's docs, apps, and
  people. Onyx provides a feature rich Chat interface and plugs into any LLM of
  your choice. Keep knowledge and access controls sync-ed across over 40
  connectors like Google Drive, Slack, Confluence, Salesforce, etc. Create
  custom AI agents with unique prompts, knowledge, and actions that the agents
  can take. Onyx can be deployed securely anywhere and for any scale - on a
  laptop, on-premise, or to cloud.
