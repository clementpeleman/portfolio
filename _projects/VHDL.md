intro: |
  Unified was created in response to the ever-growing demand for a set of
  universally appropriate icons suitable for projects I work on, both
  commercially and personally.

  This icon set is an ongoing project with new icons being introduced
  constantly, to date there are around 500 icons, not all of which are available
  for purchase yet.
