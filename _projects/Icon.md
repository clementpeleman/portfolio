intro: |
  This project showcases a user-centered approach to designing the ICON Bike Light, a sleek and intuitive lighting solution for cyclists. Focusing on simplicity and usability, the design process emphasizes a seamless user journey from unboxing to everyday use.

  This sleek lighting solution utilizes magnets for a seamless attachment and removal process, allowing cyclists to quickly snap the light on and off their bike. The magnetic mechanism ensures secure placement during rides while making it incredibly easy to take off when leaving the bike unattended or when recharging.
