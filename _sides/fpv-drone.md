intro: |
  In my free time, I like to fly FPV. FPV stands for First-Person-View. It means that you fly based on what a little camera in the drone sees. This video feed is sent in realtime to goggles that you wear on your face. I built this drone myself and designed a simple GoPro mount, which I 3D-printed.

      ## Custom Build Process
      
      This FPV racing drone was built from scratch using high-quality components selected for performance and durability. The frame is lightweight yet robust, designed to withstand crashes while maintaining optimal flight characteristics.
      
      ### Key Features
      - Custom 3D printed GoPro mount
      - High-performance FPV camera system
      - Real-time video transmission to goggles
      - Optimized for racing and freestyle flying
